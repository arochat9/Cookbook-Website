# Cookbook Website

* This cookbook website is meant to be a tool I can use to hold all my favorite recipes!
* Right now, there isn't a lot on it, however it is very easy to add more recipes, since each page is the same html file, just reading off of json code.
* The header was hand-drawn, and all of the images were taken by me.
* The website was coded in html and css, with some javascript.
